# C867 Scripting and Programming - Applications


This project is the PA for WGU's C867 course and is intended to demonstrate knowledge learned from the coursework, and skill in general usage of c++.


## Features of this program:
- Parses and stores student data from a given table, defined in main.cpp
- Adds, removes, and displays student information
- Ensures correct email address formatting from email addresses provided in the student data table
- Calculates the average time for course completion in days for students
- Can list students by degree program

## Compilation:
- I have not provided any files (such as those under .vscode) for compiling and running this program. This is dependent on IDE and should be done yourself.
